## What does this have to do with Craft-Web?
If you have the mod [Classic Peripherals](https://modrinth.com/mod/classicperipherals), Craft-Web supports usage of their Radio Towers. In order to build a Radio Tower, check out their [docs](https://github.com/Ale32bit/ClassicPeripherals/wiki).

## I have my Radio Tower, what now?
1. Get two Advanced Computers
2. Place the computer you plan to have as the server near the Radio Tower
3. Put a wired modem on any side of the computer (or where works best for you), and attach it to the Radio Tower's modem using Networking Cables
4. Install the RTC script onto that computer 
    - *If you don't know how to get the script, check [Home](index.md) for download links*
5. Place another computer anywhere on map (Not too for from the radio tower)
6. Attach the Radio Antenna on top of the computer
7. Install Craft-Web
